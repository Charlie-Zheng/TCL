## Preface

Special thanks to [Windrise Venti Mains](https://discord.com/invite/ventimains) teams for providing fundings for this guide. Also to Kimi\#9348 for taking words out of my mouth and putting it to paper.

And of course this guide would not be possible without the whole Keqing mains theorycrafting community.

## Overview

All calculations below assume you have a highly invest Venti, who is a premier sub DPS on most quickswap teams. However, you can opt into other options like support Venti or even main DPS Venti \(which we do not recommend\).

## Weapons Overview

### TLDR;

Skyward Harp reigns supreme for Venti's damage output and will probably continue to do so.

| Weapon Name | Damage as % of Prototype Crescent |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skyward Harp | 124.3% |
| Alley Hunter R5 | 123.3% |
| Stringless R5 | 115.4% |
| Amos's Bow | 112.5% |
| Alley Hunter R1 | 111.7% |
| The Viridescent Hunt | 106.6% |
| Stringless R1 | 103.8% |
| Sacrificial Bow R5 | 102.2% |
| Windblume Ode R5 | 101.0% |
| Elergy for the End  | 100.2% |
| Blackcliff Warbow \(0 stacks\) | 100.0% |
| Rust/Prototype Crescent | 100.0% |
| Favonius Warbow | 86.0% |

Note: Damage for The Viridescent Hunt is calculated with passive included, which requires some normal attacks to be done. This can be done while waiting for particles after skill use. It also allows for fall damage abuse which is not included in the calculations. The passives for Blackcliff Warbow and Prototype Crescent are not included in their calculations.

### Five Star Weapons

**Skyward Harp**

By far the best weapon choice for Venti. High base attack. Harp's main stat is CR and its passive gives CD which makes building Venti easier. Plus the passive adds a lot of extra damage and isn't completely wasted like some other 5 star weapons' passives.

**Amos' Bow**

Technically often the 2nd/3rd best weapon choice for Venti if you happen to have it. Its passive is pretty much completely wasted on Venti though. Still, the huge ATK% and the high base attack of a 5 star bow carries the Amos' Bow here. But if you have a Ganyu or someone else who uses the passive, it might be better to slot this on them due to how strong Stringless or Alley Hunter can be on Venti.

**Elegy for the End**

The newest 5 star addition which clearly was tailor-made with Venti in mind. The problem is that Venti himself can't take much advantage of the bow's passive as his ult snapshots and won't take into account additional ATK% from Elegy for the End's passive**.** At best only 1 of your E casts will make use of it. Combined with ER main stat, this makes Elegy for the End to do less damage than most of the 4 stars available for Venti. 

On the other hand the additional 100 EM and 20% ATK are great for your main DPS carry in vaporize/melt teams and may lead to overall higher team output than you would get with Amos or even Harp, however it is whale territory and you need a hyper invested carry to pull it off.

### Four Star Weapons

**Alley Hunter**

The best 4 star option. It's basically a Stringless with ATK% main stat. Beats Amos at R2 and almost equal to it at R1. The downside is that you can't stay on the field for longer than 4 seconds, which Venti normally never needs to. If you for some reason do stay on field for more than 4 seconds it's worse than Stringless \(RIP 4 player coop gamers\)

**The Stringless**

A very good option for Venti! The passive of this is incredibly strong especially at higher refinements. However, in the end it's still a bow with elemental mastery main stat and its performance varies a lot more than other bows on the list, depending on how many swirls you can proc with Venti and your substats. You really have to try hard to balance your ATK, ER, CR, and CD, which are all lacking on this bow.

This drawback is somewhat mitigated with higher refinements, but at R1 it is not necessarily better than other 4 star bows even if the damage table indicates otherwise. In the calculations we assume almost perfect conditions for Stringless, which is arguarbly a lot harder for it to achieve than for any other bow on the list. Basically, if you only have R1 Stringless, it's not that different from the other 4 star bows \(except Fav\).

**The Viridescent Hunt**

27.6% CR is higher value and harder to get with artifacts than Blackcliff Warbow's 36.8% CD. It allows you to have a lot easier time building Venti. To take full advantage of the bow however, you would need to trigger its passive consistently. This can be done by doing some autoattacks while you wait for particles after casting Venti's elemental skill . The passive can also be used for fall damage abuse, but after recent changes it is inconsistent and hard to trigger.

**Sacrificial Bow**

A much better Energy Recharge option than Favonius mostly due to higher base attack and extra E's adding some total damage. Its total damage potential is still lower than some of the other options down the line at R1, but at higher refinement it's a really good option. Due to being an ER bow you can focus purely on offensive substats, which makes this bow very comfortable to build for and use, unlike the Stringless.

**The Blackcliff Warbow**

The Blackcliff Warbow and the Viridescent Hunt are somewhat close to each other. Blackcliff has slightly higher base attack and its passive can see some use, but the value from its main stat is slightly lower than The Viridescent Hunt. If your Venti gets a kill while he is on the field then the ATK% buff will persist to him sitting on the bench while his ult is hammering down on enemies. And since Venti's E does a lot of damage, it's sometimes possible to get some use out of this passive.

**Rust**

The problem with the Rust is that it scales slightly worse than Stringless/ Viridescent/ Blackcliff while still being quite difficult to build for. It does have a higher damage ceiling than Favonius or Sacrificial bow due to the ATK% main stat. An okay option while waiting to get lucky with a Stringless. Passive is almost useless as you will not be doing many normal attacks with Venti.

**Prototype Crescent**

Now on Venti this works identically to the Rust. 

The passive is hard to utilize by average-skilled players as most people don't play Venti to do aim-shots on the weak points on the go. However, if you can do it consistently it will give a significant DPS boost. High base attack and ATK% make this bow have a pretty good damage ceiling.

If you don't want to go for Viridescent/Blackcliff and don't have Stringless this bow is not a bad option.

**Favonius Warbow**

Venti doesn't necessarily starve for ER as much as this bow gives, considering his ult refunds 15 energy upon use and his ascension stat already being ER. Has way less potential on well built Venti and teams than other weapon options. If your Venti is poorly built and you just wanna be throwing ults out for other carries, this is an option.

## Builds

### Talent Priority

Wind's Grande Ode \(Q\) â‰¥ Skyward Sonnet \(E\) &gt; Divine Marksmanship \(Normal Attack\)

In the ideal scenario Venti's Q does more damage than his E in a normal rotation. However, I would advise to level them equally as both are really good and resource wise it would be a far better deal. Venti's auto attacks is nothing to be proud about, with some of the worst damage numbers among all archers, and can be left at level 1 or leveled to 6 depending on how much you actually use them.

### Artifact Sets

**4 Piece Viridescent Venerer \(4VV\)**

4VV is the easy go**-**to set for Venti. It boosts a teammates damage nicely and it's also the highest damage option for Venti alone, since it buffs swirl damage greatly and swirl damage still makes up a good chunk of your ult damage.

However 4 sets can be hard to get good substats in. If your substats for 4VV are very awful, and the infused element damage isn't a big deal for your teams, the below options are good choices to go for as well!

**2 Piece Viridescent Venerer 2 Piece Noblesse Oblige \(2VV2NO\)**

Now a lot of people might think this is the best option for Venti damage. But due to the 2NO bonus being additive with goblet and 2VV while the swirl damage from 4VV is just a flat 65% increase to a good chunk of Ventis ult damage, most of the time it isn't.

However the differences aren't huge. So if your teams don't use 4VV set bonus much and this gives you better substats, it's a very good option to go for.

**Note**

If your teams don't use elemental resistance reduction from 4VV, you should also consider just running 2 set bonus and 3 offset pieces with the best substats. Often subs matter more than another 2 set bonus.

### Artifact Stats

**Main Stats**

The best overall stats you should use are ATK%/Anemo/CR\(CD\). But keep in mind that having your ult to be up on cd should be your first priority. If you can't achieve it, it might be reasonable to run either ER sands with ATK% based weapon or an ER weapon instead. However, it is recommended to get ER from substats, which combined with ascension bonus, should provide you with enough energy recharge.

**How much ER do you need?**

Until you can ult off cooldown, ER has high priority. Ideally this would be around 170-180% ER, but it depnds on the rest of your team.

Venti gain ER as an ascension stat and has 132% base ER at ascension phase 6. Also, his phase 5 passive talent refunds 15 energy at the end of his ult. If Venti is level 80/90, you can only need around 40% ER from artifacts and weapons combined.

**Substats**

You are mostly looking for:

1. CR or CD
2. ATK%
3. ER%

You can check the following sheet to see what substats you should aim for:

[What stats you should aim for, for each each at different gearing stages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z5UEfzhPpEyb_0ehjGj6z9W9oiQTr_bMcNL67XNvXW0/edit)

## Constellations

### C1: Splitting Gales

_Fires 2 additional arrows per Aimed Shot, each dealing 33% of the original arrow's DMG._

Do you want to feel like Legolas firing 3 arrows per shot? Now you can! Unfortunately these arrows almost never hit your target unless you are in a point blank range. Combined with mediocre DPS from his pew-pew and the fact that Venti almost never does aimed shots, this is easily the worst Venti constellation and one of the worst in the game.

0% damage increase on average

### C2: Breeze of Reminiscence

_Skyward Sonnet decreases opponents' Anemo RES and Physical RES by 12% for 10s. Opponents launched by Skyward Sonnet suffer an additional 12% Anemo RES and Physical RES decrease while airborne._

An amazing constellation which enables Venti to use 2VV2NO set. Also one of the few sources of Anemo shred in the game.

15-16% damage increase if there is no other Anemo shred in the team, 11% otherwise.

### C3: Ode to Thousand Winds

_Increases the Level of Wind's Grande Ode by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

Ult level increase. Good.

11% damage increase.

### C4: Hurricane of Freedom

_When Venti picks up an Elemental Orb or Particle, he receives a 25% Anemo DMG Bonus for 10s._

Even without other characters generating orbs, HP thresholds orbs and any other external help, 6 sec cooldown on his elemental skill means Venti can have 100% uptime on this constellation if you don't mess up the rotation too much.

Around 10-15% damage increase depending on your set and weapon \(Pay respects to Stringless/2VV2NO users\)

### C5: Concerto dal Cielo

_Increases the Level of Skyward Sonnet by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

Elemental Skill level increase. Not Bad.

Another 5% damage increase. It doesn't mean it's bad, it's just that the base damage is so insane now, that it only increases by 5%.

### C6: Storm of Defiance

_Targets who take DMG from Wind's Grand Ode have their Anemo RES decreased by 20%. If an Elemental Absorption occurred, then their RES towards the corresponding Element is also decreased by 20%._

Congratulations! Your Venti is complete now. This constellation_,_ like all other constellation after C1, is very good but not gamechanging. It's a bit hard to utilize it to it's full potential due to delayed infuse after the first Anemo damage tick and aligning Venti's elemental skill usage to take full advantage of Anemo shred. However, even in the most brain dead playstyle this constellation still boosts your damage by a hefty amount.

5-15% damage increase depending on your rotation. Probably around 8-9% on average.

### Total

Overall Venti gains around 60-70% damage increase on his journey from ~~C0~~ C1 to C6.
