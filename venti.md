## Preface

Special thanks to [Windrise Venti Mains](https://discord.com/invite/ventimains) teams for providing fundings for this guide. Also to Kimi\#9348 for taking words out of my mouth and putting it to paper.

And of course this guide would not be possible without the whole Keqing mains theorycrafting community.

## Overview

All calculations below assume you have a highly invest Venti, who is a premier sub DPS on most quickswap teams. However, you can opt into other options like support Venti or even main DPS Venti \(which we do not recommend\).

## Weapons Overview

### TLDR;

Skyward Harp reigns supreme for Venti's damage output and will probably continue to do so.

| Weapon Name | Damage as % of Prototype Crescent |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skyward Harp | 124.3% |
| Alley Hunter R5 | 123.3% |
| Stringless R5 | 115.4% |
| Amos's Bow | 112.5% |
| Alley Hunter R1 | 111.7% |
| The Viridescent Hunt | 106.6% |
| Stringless R1 | 103.8% |
| Sacrificial Bow R5 | 102.2% |
| Windblume Ode R5 | 101.0% |
| Elergy for the End  | 100.2% |
| Blackcliff Warbow \(0 stacks\) | 100.0% |
| Rust/Prototype Crescent | 100.0% |
| Favonius Warbow | 86.0% |

Note: Damage for The Viridescent Hunt is calculated with passive included, which requires some normal attacks to be done. This can be done while waiting for particles after skill use. It also allows for fall damage abuse which is not included in the calculations. The passives for Blackcliff Warbow and Prototype Crescent are not included in their calculations.

### Five Star Weapons

**Skyward Harp**

By far the best weapon choice for Venti. High base attack. Harp's main stat is CR and its passive gives CD which makes building Venti easier. Plus the passive adds a lot of extra damage and isn't completely wasted like some other 5 star weapons' passives.

**Amos' Bow**

Technically often the 2nd/3rd best weapon choice for Venti if you happen to have it. Its passive is pretty much completely wasted on Venti though. Still, the huge ATK% and the high base attack of a 5 star bow carries the Amos' Bow here. But if you have a Ganyu or someone else who uses the passive, it might be better to slot this on them due to how strong Stringless or Alley Hunter can be on Venti.

**Elegy for the End**

The newest 5 star addition which clearly was tailor-made with Venti in mind. The problem is that Venti himself can't take much advantage of the bow's passive as his ult snapshots and won't take into account additional ATK% from Elegy for the End's passive**.** At best only 1 of your E casts will make use of it. Combined with ER main stat, this makes Elegy for the End to do less damage than most of the 4 stars available for Venti. 

On the other hand the additional 100 EM and 20% ATK are great for your main DPS carry in vaporize/melt teams and may lead to overall higher team output than you would get with Amos or even Harp, however it is whale territory and you need a hyper invested carry to pull it off.

### Four Star Weapons

**Alley Hunter**

The best 4 star option. It's basically a Stringless with ATK% main stat. Beats Amos at R2 and almost equal to it at R1. The downside is that you can't stay on the field for longer than 4 seconds, which Venti normally never needs to. If you for some reason do stay on field for more than 4 seconds it's worse than Stringless \(RIP 4 player coop gamers\)

**The Stringless**

A very good option for Venti! The passive of this is incredibly strong especially at higher refinements. However, in the end it's still a bow with elemental mastery main stat and its performance varies a lot more than other bows on the list, depending on how many swirls you can proc with Venti and your substats. You really have to try hard to balance your ATK, ER, CR, and CD, which are all lacking on this bow.

This drawback is somewhat mitigated with higher refinements, but at R1 it is not necessarily better than other 4 star bows even if the damage table indicates otherwise. In the calculations we assume almost perfect conditions for Stringless, which is arguarbly a lot harder for it to achieve than for any other bow on the list. Basically, if you only have R1 Stringless, it's not that different from the other 4 star bows \(except Fav\).

**The Viridescent Hunt**

27.6% CR is higher value and harder to get with artifacts than Blackcliff Warbow's 36.8% CD. It allows you to have a lot easier time building Venti. To take full advantage of the bow however, you would need to trigger its passive consistently. This can be done by doing some autoattacks while you wait for particles after casting Venti's elemental skill . The passive can also be used for fall damage abuse, but after recent changes it is inconsistent and hard to trigger.
